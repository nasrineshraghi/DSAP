# DSAP: Data Stream Affinity Propagation Clustering Algorithm
Cancel Changes
This algorithm is designed for data stream clustering with the landmark time window model in two phases, online and offline mode. The DSAP data stream clustering algorithm is implemented based on the Affinity Propagation(AP) algorithm.
The DSAP tested on two real-world datasets: people counter and Wifi fingerprinting localization datasets.
The landmark time window is implemented for both data points and expiration window.
