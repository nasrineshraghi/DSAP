# DSAP:  Stream Affinity Propagation Clustering Algorithm

This algorithm is designed for  stream clustering with the landmark time window model in two phases, online and offline mode. The DSAP  stream clustering algorithm is implemented based on the Affinity Propagation(AP) algorithm.
The DSAP tested on two real-world sets: people counter and Wifi fingerprinting localization sets.
The landmark time window is implemented for both  points and expiration window.
