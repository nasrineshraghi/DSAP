# DSAP: Data Stream Affinity Propagation Clustering Algorithm

This algorithm is designed for data stream clustering in two phases, online and offline mode. The DSAP data stream clustering algorithm is implemented based on the Affinity Propagation(AP) algorithm.
The DSAP tested on two real-world datasets: people counter and Wifi fingerprinting localization datasets.
